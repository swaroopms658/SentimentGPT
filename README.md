## Features

- **Advanced Sentiment Analysis**: Utilizes state-of-the-art GPT models to determine the sentiment of texts.
- **Prompt Engineering**: Employs prompt-based techniques to guide the GPT model for accurate sentiment detection.
- **Fine-Tuning Capabilities**: Offers scripts to fine-tune GPT models on custom datasets for improved performance.
- **Embedding Classification**: Integrates text embedding techniques for enhanced sentiment classification.

## Installation

To set up the project locally, follow these steps:

1. **Clone the Repository**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/swaroopms658/SentimentGPT.git
   cd SentimentGPT
   ```

2. **Create a Virtual Environment (optional but recommended)**
   ```bash
   python -m venv venv
   source venv/bin/activate   # On Windows: venv\Scripts\activate
   ```

3. **Install Dependencies**
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

## Usage

Once the installation is complete, you can use the provided scripts to perform sentiment analysis. Below are some common tasks:

### Prompt Engineering
Run the prompt engineering script with your input data:
```bash
python prompt_engineering.py --input data/your_dataset.csv --output results/predictions.csv
```

### Fine-Tuning
Fine-tune the GPT model on your dataset:
```bash
python fine_tuning.py --dataset data/your_dataset.csv --model_output models/fine_tuned_model.pt
```

### Embedding Classification
Classify sentiment based on text embeddings:
```bash
python embedding_classification.py --input data/your_dataset.csv --output results/embedding_predictions.csv
```
